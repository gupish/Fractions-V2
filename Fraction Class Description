Class Fraction

This class should be a simple abstraction (i.e., a small class) that represents the ratio of two numbers. There will be only two data elements, and only a few methods. 
Note that it is required for your Fractionclass to store your ratio in reduced form, so this is feature to implement in your software.


Data Members

The numerator – what primitive type makes the most sense here? 

The denominator – same type as the numerator.


Method Members

Overloading

Fraction() – default “no-arg” constructor

Fraction(int,int) – constructor which initializes your data


Overriding

boolean equals(Fraction other) – compares “this” to “other”

String toString() – replace this inherited method with one appropriate to the class
